        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Kia ora, I&apos;m a full stack web developer based in Pōneke, New
          Zealand. I&apos;ve always had a knack for creative hobbies, and after
          picking up coding courses online in my gap year, I discovered my love
          for coding. Since then I have attended Dev Academy, which further
          developed my tech skills and soft skills. As a wahine Māori, I am
          passionate about uplifting disadvantaged communities, and want to
          achieve this while creating artistic and accessible tech. I&apos;m
          constantly thinking of ways to improve others&apos; lives, and tech
          has provided the perfect outlet for this.
